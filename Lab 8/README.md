Taking n=100, k=5

Recursive Time (in nano seconds) = 319836849
Parallel Time (in nano seconds), with ThreadPool Size:
1 = 55428653,
2 = 33599524,
3 = 9813075

Speedup (using formula RecursiveTime/ParallelTime), with ThreadPool Size:
1 = 5.78,
2 = 9.52,
3 = 32.6

Speedup (using formula ParallelTime1/ParallelTimeX), with ThreadPool Size:
2 = 1.65,
3 = 5.65
