Taking n=100, k=5

Recursive Time (in nano seconds) = 304699672
Parallel Time (in nano seconds), with ThreadPool Size:
1 = 36487877,
2 = 162176,
3 = 108506

Speedup (using formula RecursiveTime/ParallelTime), with ThreadPool Size:
1 = 8.35,
2 = 1878.82,
3 = 2008.14

Speedup (using formula ParallelTime1/ParallelTimeX), with ThreadPool Size:
2 = 225,
3 = 336.27
